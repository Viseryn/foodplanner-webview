# foodplanner-webview

A WebView APK wrapper for the FoodPlanner PWA, see [Viseryn/foodplanner](https://github.com/Viseryn/foodplanner). To use it, modify the `url` variable in [`MainActivity.kt`](https://github.com/Viseryn/foodplanner-webview/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/yuselnet/foodplanner/MainActivity.kt).

The advantage of this wrapper is that it could make use of Android 13's Dynamic Color Themes in the future. Also, coloring the status and navigation bar is possible and compatible with dark mode.
